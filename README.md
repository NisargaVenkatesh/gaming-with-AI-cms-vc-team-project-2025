# Crimson Pact: AI-Powered 2D Survival Game

**Crimson Pact** is a 2D rogue-like survival game built using Unity and enhanced with a reinforcement learning agent trained via Unity ML-Agents.  
Inspired by _Vampire Survivors_, the game is a team project developed under CMS-VC and CMS-CLS modules at TU Dresden (2025).

---

## Project Objectives

- Build a dynamic game environment with enemies, hazards, and powerups.
- Train an AI agent using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.
- Evaluate performance, learning stability, and gameplay behavior.

---

## Tech Stack

- Unity 6.1
- Unity ML-Agents Toolkit
- Python 3.10
- TensorBoard (for training visualization)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) + Unity Editor 6.1 or later
- Python 3.10+
- ML-Agents Toolkit (`mlagents==0.30.0` or compatible)

---

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv mlagentvenv
source mlagentvenv/bin/activate  # or .\mlagentvenv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# 2. Install ML-Agents and required packages
pip install mlagents tensorboard matplotlib pandas
```

---

### Training the Agent

```bash
mlagents-learn player_config.yaml --run-id=CrimsonRun1 --env=Game
```

> Training results will be saved in the `results/CrimsonRun1/` folder.

---

### Playing the Game

1. Open the project in Unity Hub
2. Load the `Main Menu` scene
3. Select one of the following modes:
   - **Manual** (you control the player)
   - **AI** (trained AI)
4. Press **Play** and observe how the AI behaves.

---

## Evaluation & Visualization

- Run training visualizations using TensorBoard:
  ```bash
  tensorboard --logdir=results/
  ```
